Changes: v1.0-2013.11.27.9:10:00MST (ell)
0) Add in mate_cdmat, dispout_cdmat, dispin_cdmat == 3 processes then to control for movement. Still need to read in dispin_cdmat....
1) Update age distribution file more, remove reside probilities, this is included within the stray (rearing populations) and within the migrate (natal populations). Added additional male:female sex ratio option  as last field Percent Female - not sure this is the correct option, but for now.
2) Place holder for loadFile for agedistribution.csv - these will be header file read in lines - function call - Not sure will use or not.
3) 

Changes: v1.0-2013.11.22.17:33:00PST (ell)
0) Decided to take cdpop code and add in cdfish functions.
1) First, update input file header information - add any fields missing from cdfish to cdpop - residency and straying.
2) Option 7 for dispersal movement in cdfish v056 not in cdpop, add in eventually...

Changes: v0.56-2013.11.22.15:36:00PST (ell)
0) {Not completed yet} Updated agefile to include probabilites for natal and rearing populations.

Changes: v0.56-2013.11.15
0) Change to agedistribution.csv file. Added Male/Female mature/migrate/juvenile probilities columns.
1) Input file age mortality removed, added to age file.

1) Error in overlapping generations - carefull check through code with cdpop FID removed and added back in - updated DoAdultMortalityCode().
2) Sweep through CDFISH and clean up code.
3) Added option '7' for disperse movement - user defined maximum and minimum movement thresholds now can be specified within movement threshold option by '|'.

Changes: v0.52-2012.09.07.11:41:00MST (ell)
0) Error in straying function weighted option 6 - rearranged loop to avoid indexing into cdmatrix and source_subpop array.
1) Added 'known' genes option.

Changes: v0.52-2012.07.15.17:38:00MST (ell)
0) Weight straying by migration function: i.e., if migration back to home subpopulation has a probability of 0 (no one can make it) then strayers should not be able to make it there either.

Changes: v0.52-2012.03.17.15:17:00MST (ell)
0) Straying function option '6' was not working correctly. Was scaling to cost to source. Corrected.
1) Added structure src, doc, data folders for cdfish like cdpop.

Changes: v0.52-2012.02.26.08:46:00MST (ell)
0) Corrected the inverse square function with 1/(x^2+1).
1) Added the min-max linear function (1/(min-max))*(X-min)+1 as option '6' in both dispersing and straying.
2) NEED to speed up cdfish like in cdpop v1.1.

Changes: v0.52-2011.09.04.13:46:00MST (ell)

2) Added variable initial alleles per locus with | separator.

Changes: v0.51-2011.08.20.12:58:00MST (ell)
0) Found and error counting populations parameters, unique_subpops is not in order. Searched rest of code for this error potentially too.
1) Found same error in dispersal at residency.
2) Found same error in modules at getting subtotal.
3) And in preprocess...checking cdpop now.
4) Fixed het numbers, if no subpopulation there, then het is 0.0.
5) FOund error when I strayed...strayers '12from2' form and now I split by 'from' for a migrator.
6) Again found this error in dispersal function.

Changes: v0.51-2011.07.30.14:57:00MST (ell)
0) Redid _Disperse() to order or residency, straying, and then migrating.

Changes: v0.50-2011.05.22.14:09:00MST (ell)
0) Some errors in HS and HI calculations fixed.
1) Added subpopulation Males and Females to output.csv

Changes: v0.50-2011.05.19.13:11:00MST (ell)
0) Add more subpopulation information to GetMetrics. Alleles, Ho and He will be displayed in output.csv file as HoTotal|Ho1|Ho2..|HoN, for N subpopualtions with a bar separatingvalues. Same for He and Alleles. A user then can calculate Fst between subpopuations.
1) Added GetmaxCDValue() to PreProcess.py

Changes: v0.50-2011.03.31.10:06:00MST (ell)
0) Code clean up.

2) Added more comments and function information.
3) Removed directory hard code.

Changes: v0.50-2011.03.30.08:02:00MST (ell)
0) Dispersal conditions were getting stuck in inf loop, fixed this problem...due to subpop spots open and offspring left that did not belong to any open subpops.
1) Fixed GetMetrics section, added FIS, FIT.

Changes: v0.01-2011.03.23.11:58:00MST (ell)
0) Add straying during dispersal: added a straying percentage to of each subpopulation for an offspring that does not make it home, seperated by '|'.
1) Added Equal sex ratios...as each new grid is read in, the sex is written over...be careful here.
2) Check F with replacement M with replace code segment...need to grab with replacement equal Bearpairs from each subgrid.

Changes: v0.01-2011.03.18.16:08:00MST (ell)
0) Automate GetMetrics() to calculate metrics based on subpopulation numbers.  Need to add Fis and Fit.
1) Clean up code a bit, remove subpopulation total from user input.
2) Added {filename}.xy for naming convention of xyfilename input parameter.
3) Added cost distance matrix to code. Naming convention {filename}.cd. Added ReadCDMat() in CDFISH_PreProcess().
4) Begin residency code: This will be a probability that offspring do not make it back to source, but stay in subpopulation.  Added 'residency' parameter...this is the percent of the open locations after adult mortality that will get occupied by an offspring.

Changes: v0.01-2011.03.13.09:28:00MST (ell)
0) Begin CDFISH walk through.
1) Added sys.exit for when population is either 0 or 1.
2) Added sys.exit for when population is either all females or all males.
3) Added case in DoMate() for when only one kind of sex left in a subpopulation else it was stuck in inf loop.
4) Code working with xyED64 and offspring number 3 and lmdba 10 and lmdba 1.  Cost to source set to 0 for each subpopulation.
5) Begin checks with test case and actual cost to travel with thresholds.  Cost to source not set to 0 for each subpopulation.

Changes: v0.01-2011.03.09T07:32:00MST (ell)
0) Removed sex-specific dispersal option.
1) Begin code for non-constant populations (subpopulations can go extinct).
2) Removed geneswapgen.
3) Removed braycurtis and Da and gendmatans.
4) In GetMetrics() removed left and right calculations of population metrics...will need to update this function in future to calculate metrics for given number of subpopulations.
5) Removed reproage

Changes: v0.01-2011.03.02T091700MST (ell)

CDFISH v0.01-2011.0104T094800MST (ell)
0) Begin branching of CDFISH.
1) Added to inputvariables 'Subpopulations', 'SourceToSubpop'.  This field will included N cost distance values for each subpopulation seperated by |.
2) Added inputvariable fields to code.
3) Renamed modules CDFISH.
4) Major restructuring and reformating CDPOP...too many changes to keep track of.
5) Offspring more than free grid cells -> Constant populations returning back to original population tested.

Changes: v0.93-2010.12.30T1650 (ell)
0) Found some minor erros in function passing when intgeneans == file and allelefrequency file is specified.
1) Found out that CDPOP_Mate.py Freplace == Y and Mreplace == N AND Freplace == N and Mreplace == N does not exist.  Put print functions in with sys.exit(-1)...code in later.
2) mtDNA: If Y, then last loci becomes mtDNA and every offspring gets this locus from mother only.  If N, then regular Mendal inheritance for the last loci.

Changes: v0.93-2010.12.28T093000 (ell)
0) CDCLIMATE work begin...
1) Added to user_input.ip and inputvariables.csv: CDCLIMATE (Y and N), cdclimgentime (mod 0 of looptime), futurematecdmat, futuredispcdmat, futrexycdmatrixfilename
2) Added above parameters to CDPOP.py.

Changes: v0.92-2010.12.23T090900 (ell)
0) CDINFECT work begin...
1) Added parameters cdinfect to switch it on or off.
2) Added parameters transmissionprob to flip the coin to see if offspring infected.
3) If cdinfection, create a random status infection 0 or 1 -- initialize the population.  If not cdinfect, create status 0 infection for all individuals and intialize.  Add column to grid.csv output after sex column and before genes.
4) If mother or father has infection, then flip coin for transmission probability and if random coin flip is less than transmission probability, assign a 1 for infected offspring.
5) Rearrange functions, made new ones: InitializeInfect()
6) Begin Gene2 work...genes stored as general format. 

Changes: v0.91-2010.12.21T02:49 (ell)
0) Added DispCDmatans.
1) Added mtDNA option...not in code, need to talk to Gordon to make sure I understand how this is swapped.
2) Turn 'max' into a function GetMaxCDValue() to CDPOP_PreProcess()

Changes: v0.91-2010.12.11T08:52 (ell)
0) Added 3 fitness surfaces for OffspringMortalityFitness, one for each genotype.
1) Fix DoImmigration() error, list index out of range...within cdevolve section for both emigration and immigration, was not deleting the probarray within the while loop.
2) Begin stubbing DoImmigration()/DoEmigratin(), created CDPOP_Disperse.py and within created DoLinearDisperse(), DoInverseSquareDisperse(), DoNegExpDisperse()....

Changes: v0.91-2010.11.23T09:00:00 (ell)
0) New version: added new movement functions, negative exponential y = a10^-bx with matemoveparA and matmoveparB parameters. Added 6 functions to CDPOP_Mate.py
1) Added FdispmoveparA, FdispmoveparB, MdispmoveparA, MdispmoveparB

Changes: v0.90-2010.11.05.09:51 (ell)
0) New version: begin CDEVOLVE work.
1) Change user_input.ip and inputvariables.csv to include 'cdevolve' answer.  This is Y or N to turn this module on or off.
2) Change user_input.ip and inputvariables.csv to include LociSelect.  This is the loci and allele under selection, e.g., L0A1|L0A4.
3) Change user_input.ip and inputvariables.csv to include fitsurface.  This is the ascii file .txt, tab delimited fitness surface that defines differential mortality for an offspring given loci under selection.
4) Tested above with test files: CDTable1000_pts1, edcdmatrix_pts1, Pnts1, fitvals0_0, set at max movement thresholds.
5) In CDPOP_Modules added PrepTextFile()
6) In CDPOP_Modules in DoPreProcess() added ReadFitnessSurface() function to read in the fitness surface ascii file in CDPOP_PreProcess()
7) Extracted header file information from fitvalues.
8) Store fitness values for each xy location spot: get xll, yll to be in center location, get xfitval,yfitval, run closet point check on xgrid,ygrid to xfitval, yfitval, and then find closest fitnessvalue to xgrid, ygrid, storing it in fitvals list.  THIS SECTION NEEDS TO USE KDTREE AND SPEED UP.
9) Step 8 way too slow...rewrote using KDTREE and SCIPY now needed.
10) DoDisperse() -- passed in cdevolveans, fitvals, lociselect.
11) DoEmigration() -- Movement1and2: line 500-560 after itemselect, add differentialmortality based on fitnessvalues in while loop until offspring survives to take that spot.  Be careful to add this same logic everywhere!  Right now only added for movement 1 and 2.
12) DoEmigration() -- Movement4: lines639 - 692 added 11) logic to panmixia.
12) DoEmigration() -- Movement3: lines611-671 added 11) logic to nearest neighbor.
13) DoImmigratin() -- Movement1,2,3,4 added 11) logic. 
14) Removed DoOffspringMortality()...in logic from 11, if not lociselected, then apply newmortperc to offspring.
15) Track allele frequency of the first locus (p) at each generation...created a deltap and append all_freq_tot[0] to as p...added deltap to output file.
16) Track w11, w12, w22 -- the relative fitness of the three genotypes...Track total zygotes with each genotype in OffDisperseIN, get proportion and then max for relative fitness.
17) Relative fitness values do not change every year, removed 16)
18) Deleted loci under select column.  Just assume first loci under selection.
19) Added Adult_Mortality_Fitness, Offspring_Mortality_Fitness, and Fecundity_Fitness columns to inputvariables.csv and user_input.ip.
20) Added if AA and Aa, then go to fitness surface.
21) in DoAdultMortality() added section to apply Adult_Mortality_Fitness
22) Recap: Turn AdultMortFit off by setting oldmortperc == AdultMortFit.  Turn OffspringMortFit off by setting newmortperc == OffspringMorFit.  These 2 surfaces are viability selection in terms of mortality.  Fitness surfaces used for genotypes AA and Aa.  Global mortality used for aa.  Fecundity surface is proportion of offspring for aa.  Use with constant offspring at set level (eg 10, 10 offspring for every mother with AA and Aa).  Then Fecundity selection is preformed for aa individuals and fitness surface at proportion of set offspring level (eg .10 would produce 1 offspring for every mother with aa).
23) Added fecundityfitsurface: first error check if cdevolveans = Y, then offno == 3.  Then DoOffspringCDEvolve() function in DoOffspring().  If Mother has AA or Aa, then apply lmdba for offspring number.



Changes: v0.89-2010.10.27.11:26 (ell)
0) When equalsexratio == N, then carries a return character on end of sex field.  stripped this value when read in line 762 in _Modules.py


Changes: v0.89-2010.10.17-07:59 (ell)
0) Continue debugging DoGridOut_general() function, was not spitting out the nthfile values.
1) Stubbed ReadCDMatrix() and ReadXYCDMatrix() and ReadXY() and ReduceCDMatrix() and InitializeAge() and InitializeGenes()
2) Begin CDMetaPop work...
3) Added matecdmatrixfilename and dispmatrixfilename in input variables.
4) Call this function twice ReadCDMatrix() to read in matecdmatrixfile and dispcdmatrixfile.
5) Created CDPOP_PreProcess.py library.
6) Follow cdmatrix throughout code, changing and adding matecdmatrix or dispcdmatrix where appropriate.
7) Removed DoCostDistanceMatrix dependency.


Changes: v0.89-2010.10.02-06:34 (ell)
0) Incorporated Joe's RipMgr
1) Incorporated logMsg() and begin logging dialogue.
2) Split up CDPOP_Modules, included CDPOP_PostProcess.py
3) Added grid output option format (CDPOP and General for now). DoGridOut_cdpop0(), DoGridOut_cdpop(),DoGridOut_general() functions stubbed.
4) Split up CDPOP_Modules, included CDPOP_Mate.py, CDPOP_Offspring, and CDPOP_GetMetrics.py
5) Begin to redo CDPOP with general genes format throughout code.

NOT FIXED: v0.88-2010.09.11-11:34 (ell)  Hit another error.  Need to fix.  When 'List' is specified and if 'nthfile_seq' > 1, then error index out of range.  grid0.csv is not written correctly....wait, when looptime was 5, and nthfile_seq was 6 it ran fine...only when nthfile_seq=10 did it incorrectly write grid0.csv file.  hmmm, fix later.

Changes: v0.88-2010.09.02-12:20 (ell)
0) Needed to run CDPOP and hit some errors...note that when Mmovefunction is 1 and Fmovefunction 2, something bizarre is happening with offspring sex...I did not fix this yet, will require some more thorough debugging.
1) Error when equalsexratio == N...at start of cdmatrix creation...fix later.
2) Included movement thresholds 25max, 50max, 75max if else statements.
3) Except/try added to code for checks on import statements.  Note commented out Joe's RipMgr as I am testing code for another project to be run on other computers.  Also found out that import random has to come after import numpy.random, not sure what this is doing.

v0.88-2010June15--1500 - Code completely modular.  Will begin sub-
	module changes next.
      -2010June20--20:30 - Stubbing modules. Also change import Numpy as np - use this convention.
      -2010June22--15:13 - DoMate() 24 stubs.  Also changed nthfile_seqence and nthfile_list to be 0|4|5 instead of 0 4 5, so that Joe's parser can handle this exception.
      -2010June23--16:23 - DoOffspring() 5 stubs. Also removed function w_choice(), since I only ever use w_choice_general()
      -2010June27--Continued stubbing...InheritGenes() not stubbed, DoAdultMortality() not stubbed, DoDisperse stubbed to DoEmigration() and DoImmigration(), DoOutput() not stubbed, DoPostProcess() stubbed to 5.
      -2010July08--Rearrange xygrid.csv input file to have columns Subpopulation, XCoord, YCoord, ID, Sex...no more FID.  Beginning to track these changes in code to make CDPOP run.  Working but not sure special cases tracking subpopulations...need to still check this.  Got Immigrants to work.
 v0.87-2010May16--12:04 --Some changes, but beginning to modularize.
	1. Create unique batchfolder output with datetime stamp: added foldertime
	variable.
	2. Removed most of the print statements.
	3. Begin _Modules script to store functions
	4. Begin incorporating RipMgr
	5. From Nev Amos, non-overlapping generations giving an error:
		- agelst was not correct for the file agedistribution
		- possible error when there are no Births...This will need
		to be checked well in future when testing overlapping gens
	6. Program Steps restructured:
	Step 0: Import packages
	Step 1: Start timer, get script arguments
	Step 2: Call DoUserInput()
	Step3: Begin Batch Looping
	Step 4: Begin Monte-Carlo Looping
	Step 5: Create storage variables
	Step 6: Call DoPreProcess
	Step 7: Start Generation Looping
	Step 8: Call ReadGrid()
	Step 9: Call GetMetrics()
	Step 10: Call DoMate()
 v0.86-2010May11--09:20 -- M.Jacobi's GUI
	1. I changed nthfile options to match GUI, 
	included, nthfile_yn: a boolean answer to tell user that if 'Y', then
	read nthfile_list and if 'N', then read nthfile_seq.  nthfile_list: is
	a discontiguous range of integer values.  nthfile_seq is a start, end, by
	value range to give even intervals where user specifies the value by.
	2. I added a mod check for nthfile_seq, in case value is not an even
	divisible number.  I add a max check for nthfile_list, in case max
	list value from user is greater than the total looptime.  Truncates
	values in all cases.
	3. I rearrange input variables once again to make more sense to user...
	Put twopopans next to panans.
	4. Removed 'Reproans' -- not used and sex specific movement included
	in movement functions and thresholds now.
	5. Removed 'Locians' -- not coded yet and include in future...
	2010Apr27--18:48 -- I found an error with Nevil Amos's work when
	equalsexratio == 'Y' and there are odd nogrids.  If this happens to be
	the case, which doesn't make sense with equalsex ratio and an odd
	number of grids, then I added a random draw of a sex for the left
	over grid spot.
 v0.85-2010Feb28--11:51 -- This version adds sex specific movement for 
	dispersal across functions and threshold values.  
	Here is list of the following code changes:
	1. inputvariablesv0_85.csv includes Fdispersemoveno, Mdispersemoveno
		Fdispersemovethresh, and Mdispersemovethresh
	2. March 08 also fixed when cdmatrix is all zeros and movement threshold
		is set to 'max', then >= sign causes nobody to mate-up, thanks A.Shirk.
		on line 1247 changed '>=' to '>'
 v0.84-2010Jan14--21:44 -- Clean up CDPOP!
	1. range to xrange
	2. formatting...
	3. deleting varibles hanging around...
	4. Also allowed sex column to be F and M -- before they were 0 and 1.
	5. FID values also can be any number -- before they were 0 - nogrids-1
	6. Fixed linux error with creating folders '\\' to '/'
	7. Removed dependency on agefile and allelefile:  added 'N' to skip code
	segment that reads in these files and won't need to include these files
	in the directory location.  Moved the order around for th inputvariables.
 v0.83-2009Mar21--13:25 -- A few more changes made to get a Wright-Fisher 
	population...also doing some cleanup as I go along.
	1. Need to grab females and males with replacement until nogrid times.
	Code before only did this for nofemale times.  This is fine for the panmictic
	case, but when there are cost distance matrices not equal to zero than
	immigrants can come in potentially.  inputvariables now has 'twopopans': 
	'Y' == assumes that [0,nogrids/2) is population 1 and [nogrids/2,nogrids] is
	population 2.  'N' == assumes that there is only 1 population.  
	2. Mutation rate changed AGAIN.  'per locus per generation' actually means
	 that the mutation rate is applied to each allele at each locus for offspring.
	A bit confusing, eh?  So I removed the /2 after muterate.
	3. Removed plotans section...no need to provide this...along with pylab.
	4. Removed analysisans section...no need to provide this, will work on later.
 v0.82-2009Mar19--12:22 -- A few changes made to get a Wright-Fisher 
	population:
1. mating with replacement for females and males.  Code before used replacement in males only and without replacement in females.  
	inputvariables now has a column for an answer for Freplace: Y==Females 
	mate with replacement, N==Females mate without replacement.  
	And Mreplate: Y==Males mate with replacement, N==Males mate without 
	replacement.  Note that there are only N,Y and Y,Y cases for Female 
	replacement, Male replacement.  Other cases will have to be coded in later. 
	2. Also added selfans: Y==selfing
	allowed in the sexans==N case or the one sex case, and N==selfing not
	allowed in the sexans==N case or the one sex case.
	3. Change offspring number section.  Random draw between 0 and lmbda, 
	instead of the set 0 and 5 before.  Constant number set to lmbda now...
	removed offno 4 choice, constant assignment is offno==3 with lmbda as
	the constant value assigned to each mate pair.
	4. Mutation rate changed!  Code before was getting expected number of 
	mutations per generation = 2 * number of loci * number of offspring * mute-
	rate.  Apparently mutation rate should be the expected number of mutations
	per generation = number of loci * number of offspring * muterate.  So I 
	simply took the muterate code sections and inserted muterate/2.
 v0.81-2009Mar02-11:45 -- Panmictic cases not calculated average mate distance
	and average disperal distance...would report a zero, since it was grabbing
	cost distance values for the calculation.  Now it uses the xgrid and ygrid
	distance instead of the xycdmatrix values, plus cost distance values.  The
	4 average distance numbers are then reported out in output.csv (MateDistED,
	DispDistED, MateDistCD, and DispDistCD).
 v0.80-2009Feb04-09:45 -- Movement function and threshold seperated into
	mating and dispersal functions.   moveno is not split up into matemoveno and
	dispmoveno.  movethresh is split up into matemovethresh and 
	dispmovethresh.
 v0.70-2008Dec05-12:45 -- A series of issues fixed...This version is ment to 
	analyzed the output using Rpy...Added analysis option using RPy.  analysisans 
	== 'Y' will implement Mantel test the distance matrices that were created  
 	using robjects....not coded yet.
	1. Fixed a 0.0 xycdmatrix issue in panans = N.  Might be a small chance that
	2 points are a cost distance of 0 from each other...make probability 1.0 then.
	3. Removed plotting function...for now.
	4. Changed all 'bear' references to id or individual
 v0.697-2008Dec10-10:00 -- Added Fst numbers...F, Fst, Fis, Fit.
 v0.696-2008Dec09-09:45 -- Other issues come up before I can finish the 0.70
	Rpy analysis code segment for v0.70...
	1. Added MateDistED and DispDistED to the list of tracking
	variables that is outputed to output.csv.
	2. Should speed up program: only print out grid{nthfile}.csv...also, program
	does not read from file grid{gen}.csv...read from memory.	
	3. Added time,datetime to track simulation time.
 v0.695-2008Dec07-14:43 -- Added a batch file loop.  inputvariables.csv can now
	include multiple lines to be read in.
	Added a column in inputvariables to specify file for the x,y coords of the 
	cdmatrix.
 v0.69-2008Dec05-10:45 -- Removed the differeing number of alleles/locus at
	the end of the inputvariables.csv file and added nthfile slots.  This will 
	allow calculation of the genetic distance to be based on a specified sequ.
	of generations, eg, 0,1,2,3,4,5,10,20,50...instead of the nthfile=5 for 0,5,10,...
	If nthfile == 'Y', then code will read in the end of the inputvariables.csv file
	where the specified generations are listed to calculated those generations
	distance matrices.  Enter a number for a range of step sizes, eg, nthfile=5
	for 0,5,10,...,looptime.
 v0.63-2008Nov21-11:17 -- Added options for calculating genetic distance matrix
	Specify gendmatans to be 'braycurtis', 'Dps', 'Da' or 'N'. Dps == Proportion
	of shared alleles from Bowcock etal 1994.  Da == Nei's genetic distance 
	from Nei etal 1983.  N == no genetic distance matrix will be calculated.
 v0.62-2008Nov19-16:18 -- Corrected mutation code.  Before the 2 alleles at each
	locus from both the mother and father had a chance of mutating before being
	passed on to the offspring (possible 4 mutations occuring at each locus).  Now, 
	the alleles are passed to an offspring (1 from the mother and 1 from the father 
	at each locus) and the passed alleles have the chance of mutation (possible 2
	mutations occuring at each locus).
 v0.61-2008Nov10-15:35 -- If genetic information is known about the initial pop-
	ulation, then user input changed: freqfileans to intgenesans - 3 choices.
	1) if 'file', then read from allelefrequency.csv file and draw allele freq
	from this distribution. 2) if 'random', then alleles are initialized with a
	equal random choice (this maximizes genetic divesity in the population). 
	3) if 'known', then the genetype of each individual is all ready known and
	included in the xyfilename.csv file.
 v0.60-2008Oct30-14:03 -- Added mutation.  User choice muterate added to input-
	variables.csv.  An allele has this chance of mutating to another allele based on
	the KAM (Kth-Allele-Model).
	Added AllelesMutated plotting variable too.
 v0.55-2008Oct27-09:40 -- Coded segment sexans == Y for moveno==4: panmictic sexual
	reproduction.  Still loop through the number of females, but choosing a random
	male for a mate.  Offspring still disperse from female location, but to a random
	freegrid opening. 
 v0.50-2008Oct25-10:10 -- Added Monte-Carlo method functionality with mcruns in 
	inputvariables.csv user options.  Now creates mcrun(number) folder with output 
	results in directory location.
 v0.40-2008Oct23-10:45 -- Name change to CDPOP!  
	Removed user input at command line section.
	Added to inputvariables.csv, costdmatans (if Y, then the cost distance matrix
	is created for the xygrid points), Edmatans (if Y, then the Euclidean distance
	matrix is created for the xygrid points), and gendmatans (if Y, then the
	Bray-Curtis genetic distance matrices are created for every nthfile year).
	In step 10, I removed the user cmd prompts.
	Swapped step 9 and 10, so that all the plotting figures are displayed at program 
	end. 
 v0.35-2008Oct9-12:00 -- Attempts to correct sexual reproduction logic.  
	Removed MFcdmat and MFpairs from sexans==Y code and replaced the 
	equivalent matrices with xycdmatrix and extracting values with females.
	and males. 
	Removed moveno functions 4-Moore Neighborhood and now  moveno==3 will 
	refer to Nearest Neighbor Mating and Nearest Neighbor Dispersal.
	Added Indexpairs (similar to MFpairs) for error checking purposes.
	Removed offspringgenes...append genetic information onto offspring array.
 v0.34-2008Oct8-12:00 -- Step 1 moveno = 1,2 logic recoded with w_choice()
	function instead of previous cumnormprob draw.
 v0.33-2008Oct7-12:00 -- Added panans in moveno=1.  If panans == N, then code
	runs as before.  If panans == Y, then code will run with cdmatrix that has
	more than one zero in it (e.g. a panmictic situation on either side of a 
	barrier).  If panans == N, than it checks for one case in which there exists
	a zero in the cdmatrix that represents self-mating situation.  If panans == Y
	then there will be multiple cases in which there is a zero in the cdmatrix and
	a mate is choosen with equal random draw from all the zero cases.
	In addition, added movethresh = 'max' choice.  This choice allows the 
	functions to use the maximum xycdmatrix value for their probability calc-
	ulations.
 v0.32-2008Oct6-16:67 -- Coded moveno == 5 with sexans == Y for step 1.
 v0.31-2008Oct3-13:20 -- Fixed a write out error for when gen > geneswapgen 
	step 8 code.  Before the code was printing out the wrong ordering of gene
	information.  No wonder there has been no structure!
 v0.30-2008Sept28-10:15 -- Added asexual and sexual choice for each movement 
	function.  sexans added (if sexans == Y then sexual reproduction used. 
	if sexans == N then asexual reproduction used).
 v0.25-2008Sept2810:15 -- Changed logic for movement function 5 - random
	mixing with asexual reproduction.   
 v0.20-2008Sept02-14:30 -- Recoded step 7 to randomly choose an open grid 
	spot and then choose a offspring to occupy that based on movement function
	versus the previous versions in which an offspring was randomly choosen to
	dispersal to an open grid spot based on movement functions. 
 v0.13-2008July03-12:37 -- Added geneswapgen in inputvariables.csv and user
	prompt: used to initiate gene swap code.
 v0.12-2008July03-11:00 -- Added nthfile in inputvariables.csv and user prompt 
	Used to calculate genetic distance matrix for every gen mod nthfile, but
	will also use later to just Write out txt files in step 8 according to user
	defined generation year.
 v0.11-2008July03-09:00 -- Removed cdans functions.
 v0.10-2008May26-13:00 -- Created an 8-Moore Neighborhood movement function; 
	moveno='4'; by int() of the MFcdmat numbers, for example, in ED the 
	4-Moore Neighborhood around the center cell's are each 1 unit away and 
	the 4 corners are 1.41. The 8-Moore Neighborhood with int() in the 
	corner 1.41 numbers (int(1.41)==1).
 v0.01 -- Initial model work created before 5/23/2008.

 Created: February 2008
 Description: This program is a population model for xy location points.  It
	uses a cost distance matrix as a weight for probability of mating.  The 
	cost distance matrix is an input to this program. THe population remains 
	constant, therefore, each xy location point is considered to be a 'grid'
	location and birth, death, and migration processes will fill and control 
	individual 'grid' dynamics.
